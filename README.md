# Do wildfires burn up jobs in rural California?
An analysis of economic and employment responses the year after a fire event

This analysis looks at the relationship between wildfire extent and economic and employment metrics the year following the fire. Growing up in Oregon's high desert region, I learned quickly that wildfires had impacts that went beyond the decades it would take to reforest scarred hillsides; some people and industries are immediately impacted by the destruction of homes and businesses while others are affected later as the area recovers and rebuilds- or doesn't. Here, I hypothesize that wildfire extent and economic health (measured by labor force data e.g., change in rate of unemployment) are inversely correlated.
